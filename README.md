# NoRussian
Volunteer DDoS tool via HTML + JS

Opening https://norussian.tk/ or using running the HTML locally on your device (recommended - as it will bypass CORS and will work much more efficiently) will create a distributed DDoS attack on Russian websites, through complete volunteering.
Accepting code commits to improve the functions of the script, and help us reach our goal much quicker!
